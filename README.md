# Ising-Model-Using-MCMC-and-Neural-Networks
Calculating three observables, namely the magnetisation per spin, the specific heat, and the energy per spin, in the Ising model using Markov chain Monte Carlo and Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Then comparing the results from both approaches to reach a conclusion.
